Project created using laravel php and mysql backend.
I plan to clean up the code a little bit.I wrote most of it as I was learning the laravel framework and does not follow best practices.
This project was a good learning experience of creating a small CRUD application and how you can use a framework does a lot of the heavylifting.

How to get started:
git clone https://github.com/nambiarvijay/doodleclone.git 
cd doodleclone
composer install (this will create 'vendor' folder and download all packages)
Create and edit .env file
